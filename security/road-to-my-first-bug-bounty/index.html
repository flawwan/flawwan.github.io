    <h2 id="all-or-nothing">All or nothing.</h2>
<p>It was time, the day had come. I woke up, booted my computer. Grabbed some breakfast and opened Hackerone.</p>
<p>The first thing you do before you go hunting for bugs is <strong>read the program policy</strong> real careful. If go out of scope or break the policy, the company might drag you to court. Don&rsquo;t be that guy!!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  I can&rsquo;t tell you the domain of the target as it&rsquo;s a private program on Hackerone. I will reefer to them as <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The scope of the program was basically <code>*.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>I started looking for subdomains (subdomain.example.com) and found a tool called <code>Sublist3r</code> that worked really well in finding subdomains.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r">https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I had a list of 1000 subdomains. What the&hellip;. do I even do with these subdomains.</p>
<p>I went back to the main website (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>) and started playing around just focusing on testing out all the functionality.</p>
<p>What do you do when you see a search bar?</p>
<ul>
<li>You look for reflected XSS! That&rsquo;s right.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enter <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>  in the search bar and to my surprise it worked. The text wasn&rsquo;t properly escaped! wooohoo.</p>
<p>This is called <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTML_Injection_(OTG-CLIENT-003)">HTML injection</a>. Let&rsquo;s see if we can escalate this to pop an alert.</p>
<p>When I tried <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</code> the page didn&rsquo;t load and an error message was shown. Hmmm weird.</p>
<p>I suspected that there might be a WAF (Web application firewall) in front of the web server. A great tool that will detect most WAF&rsquo;s out there is <a href="https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f">WAFW00F</a>.</p>
<p>This was the result&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Kona Site Defender (Akamai)</li>
</ul>
<p>That meant I had to find a bypass&hellip; I spent two days furiously trying different stuff&hellip; All of a sudden I figured it out. There was a parsing bug in the search bar which let me control the URL of the search result. This let me bypass the WAF and pop an alert.</p>
<p>Basically it looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">a</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">href</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;javascript:confirm`1`&#34;</span>&gt;...
</code></pre></div><p><img src="/images/hackerone/xssalert.png" alt="alert" title="alert box in target website"></p>
<h3 id="final-step-report-writing">Final step: report writing</h3>
<p>The hard part was done. All I had to do now was to write a quality report report and wait for the response.</p>
<p>The report was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->closed as informative<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; What does this mean. Well it means that I&rsquo;m a dumb-ass and didn&rsquo;t read the policy all that well&hellip; Since the payload was only executed if the user typed it in manually and clicked the search result. The impact of the self-xss vulnerability was little to none. This is the reason the report got closed as informative.</p>
<h3 id="reputation-at-hackerone">Reputation at Hackerone</h3>
<p>All hackers at Hackerone start with 100 reputation. If a report is closed as resolved, you will gain +7 reputation.</p>
<p>In my case my report was closed as informative. This means my reputation will neither go up or down.</p>
<h3 id="learn-from-your-mistakes-and-come-back-stronger-next-time">Learn from your mistakes and come back stronger next time</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time on out of scope bugs. This will only waste the companies time but also yours&hellip; 2 days I could have spent on something else&hellip;</p>
<p>Also keep the tools to the minimum. Hunting subdomains right away will just waste your time when you don&rsquo;t know exactly what your looking for.</p>
<h2 id="next-blog-post">Next blog post</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how I got my first bug bounty ($$). See ya</p>
