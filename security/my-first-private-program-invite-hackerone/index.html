    <p>This will be a blog post about my experience hunting bug bounties at Hackerone. This is my first time signing up for a bug bounty platform. I will say this, I&rsquo;m not a expert. I might get some things wrong, but this is my story and my experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hackerone">What is Hackerone?</h2>
<p>Most people reading this might not know what <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;HackerOne is a vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform that connects businesses with penetration testers and cybersecurity researchers.&rdquo; - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The company set the scope of the assets that the security researcher should look into.</li>
<li>The company states which bugs are in scope.</li>
<li>The company states which bugs are out of scope.</li>
<li>And general guidelines and more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal for the security researcher is to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Find relevant bugs within the given scope.</li>
<li>Write a good report on his/her findings.</li>
<li>Communicate with the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company might then award the security researcher with a bug bounty. A thank you for finding the bug and making the web a safer place and protecting the companies assets from malicious actors.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-interested-in-bug-bounties">How I got interested in Bug Bounties</h2>
<p>Meet STÖK, a guy I stumbled upon at twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stokfredrik">https://twitter.com/stokfredrik</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started following STÖK. A couple weeks went by. I then found out that he had a youtube channel which I found very interesting. I watched one video. I then watcher another&hellip;. And another&hellip;</p>
<p>I watch every single video he had in one go. I was so hooked on finding my first bug bounty!</p>
<p>What did I do after this. I went to bed!!</p>
<p>The next day I woke up, tired. I googled for &ldquo;Bug bounty&rdquo;. I found two websites that seemed like the real deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackerone</li>
<li>Bugcrowd</li>
</ul>
<p>More youtube&hellip; Yes!!! I found Hackerone&rsquo;s youtube channel. They had a lot of interviews with hackers and their experience hunting bug bounties at Hackerone. This was also very motivating and I felt like I could do this. If they can, why can&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>Bugcrowd also had a youtube channel with some real nice burp suite tutorials that came in handy!</p>
<p>Do you even burp? Yes and no. I&rsquo;ve used burp before, I have but I&rsquo;m a great fan of OWASP ZAP. A very similar tool to burp suite, and it&rsquo;s open source.</p>
<p>After taking in all this material, it seemed like nobody used ZAP&hellip; I decided, it&rsquo;s now or never. It&rsquo;s time to uninstall ZAP and install burp suite.</p>
<p><strong>1 week later</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a CTF player for IndianTuesday. I love CTF&rsquo;s. Guess what. Hackerone has a CTF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ctf.hacker101.com">https://ctf.hacker101.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was bored and tired of studying for my exam. I signed up. Said, whatever I&rsquo;ll just complete the first easy challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CTF &gt; School</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found some flags and then I quit and went on with my day.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-day-hunting-bug-bounties-at-hackerone">My first day hunting bug bounties at Hackerone</h2>
<p>I woke up, today is the day. Today is the day I will find my first bug bounty. I was energized, had a lot of tricks up my sleeve.</p>
<p>I decided that Hackerone was the platform I was going to use. I went to pick a program.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-public-program">What is a public program?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s basically a company that is looking to have it&rsquo;s assets pentested. A public program is accessible by anyone registered at Hackerone.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-is-a-private-program">What is a private program?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A private program is not accessible by the general public. You need to be invited to be able to participate in the private program. A quick note here. Private programs at Hackerone should not be discussed publicly!</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to the story.. I picked a random public program. Spent two hours just clicking around the website, trying some random stuff. I found nothing. I was frustrated and I quit.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-private-invite-at-hackerone">My first private invite at Hackerone</h2>
<p>A week went by. I almost forgot about Hackerone. One day I was bored, I continued playing the Hackerone CTF. I managed to get 30 points. What did this mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve earned 1 invitations. 4 / 26 points to your next private invitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private invite. Huh&hellip;. Cool.</p>
<p>A few days later I got an email stating that I&rsquo;ve got an invite to a private program on Hackerone. I had one week to accept the offer.</p>
<p>1 day went by. 2 days went by&hellip; 5 days went by. On the final day I opened the invite again. I read the scope. I decided, whatever. I&rsquo;ll give it another go, the worst that could happen is that I find zero bugs. I accepted the invite.</p>
<h2 id="next-blog-post">Next blog post</h2>
<p>My next blog post will be about how I found my first bug.</p>
